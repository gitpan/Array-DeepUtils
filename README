Array-DeepUtils version 0.2
============================

DESCRIPTION

    This module is a collection of subroutines for the manipulation of
    deeply nested arrays. It provides routines for iterating along
    coordinates and for setting, retrieving and deleting values. The
    functions binary and unary are provided for applying arbitrary operators
    as code references to deeply nested arrays. With shape() and reshape()
    there are methods to determine and change the dimensions.

    By default nothing is exported. The subroutines can be imported all at
    once via the ':all' tag.

    Subroutine short description

      binary          - appply a binary operator between two nested arrays

      collapse        - flatten a nested array to a one dimensional vector

      dcopy           - extract part of a nested array between two vectors

      idx             - build an index vector for values of another vector

      purge           - remove elements by value from a nested array

      remove          - remove elements by index

      reshape         - transform nested array by dimension vector

      rotate          - rotate a data structure along its axes

      scatter         - build a new data structure with data and index vector.

      shape           - get nested array dimension vector

      subscript       - extract nested array values by index vector

      transpose       - transpose a nested array

      unary           - appply a unary operator to all values of a nested array

      value_by_path   - extract nested array values by coordinate vector

      vector_iterator - creates a subroutine for iterating between two
                            coordinates
